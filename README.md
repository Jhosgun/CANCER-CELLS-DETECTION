## Prerequisites 📋

This project was execute in colab notebook to make the models.

If you prefer run in your local machine via jupyter notebook you will require the following packages.

List of the libraries required to execute the code:

* python > 3.5
* keras 
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* opencv


## Build with 🛠️

* streamlit
* tensorflow


## Data

This project use a dataset from a competetion of kaggle, you will find in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data 

The images used were 10.000 images choosen randomly
