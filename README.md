# CNN-CANCER_CELLS_DECTECTION

In this project we use differents tecniques of deep learning to achive the maximum accuracy in our models to predict from a dataset of 10.000 cancer cells images if they have cancer or not.

## Prerequisites üìã

This project was execute in colab notebook to make the models.

If you prefer run in your local machine via jupyter notebook you will require the following packages.

List of the libraries required to execute the code:

* python > 3.5
* keras 
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* opencv


## Build with üõ†Ô∏è

* streamlit
* tensorflow


## Data

This project use a dataset from a competetion of kaggle, you will find in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data 

The images used were 10.000 images choosen randomly
